					<p> I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb I am a world's forgotten
						boy Honey gotta help me please Somebody gotta save my soul The one who searches and destroys Baby detonate for me Look
						out honey, 'cause I'm using technology Ain't got time to make no apology Soul radiation in the dead of night Love in
						the middle of a fire fight Honey gotta strike me blind Somebody gotta save my soul Baby penetrate my mind And I'm the
						world's forgotten boy The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy The one
						who's searchin', searchin' to destroy Forgotten boy, forgotten boy Forgotten boy said hey forgotten boy </p>

					<p>That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it? Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
						Now I'm drivin' 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin' And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
						And I've got this black suit on Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral Five more miles 'til the road runs out
						I'm about to drive in the ocean I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me Kick off my shoes and swim good, and
						swim good Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah Memory
						seats I'm sittin' on stay heated I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference? If I feel like a Ghost,
						no Swayze Ever since I lost my baby I've had this black suit on Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral One more
						mile 'til the road runs out I'm about to drive in the ocean I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me Kick off
						my shoes and swim good, and swim good Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good I'm goin' off (Oh, my pretty
						love) Don't try stopping me I'm goin' off (Throw me a line) Don't try saving (Broke my heart) No flares (Broke my heart)
						No vest (Drove my love) And no fear Waves are washin' me out I'm about to drive in the ocean I'ma try to swim from
						somethin' bigger than me Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good Take off this suit and swim good, and swim
						good, good</p>
